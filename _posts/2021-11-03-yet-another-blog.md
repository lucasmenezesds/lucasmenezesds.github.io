## About me
Hello!

My name is Lucas. I'm a Ruby Developer, interested in Project Management and sometimes
giving a try on the frontend, although it's been a while since the last time I worked on frontend besides my current
job's tasks.

Maybe I'll try more things in the future, starting with changing some aspects of this blog layout!

## About the blog

Yet another blog.

I've created this blog in order to improve my learnings since I think that through writing blogs post, I'll be able to
review the themes/subjects I'm studying and also improve my writing skills in English (it's been a long time since the
last time I wrote some essay or anything like that.).

Although I could have used some existing platform such as [dev.to](https://dev.to) or [Medium](https://medium.com/),
I've decided to create my own for some reason.

- I'm not worried about my posts being easily reachable or not.
- I was looking to learn more about building something like a blog.
- (Maybe) In the future, I could give it a try and customize the front end, layout, etc. :D
- My idea is to make this blog be more like a learning "notebook," but I made it public because maybe if someone finds the blog, some of the topics I wrote for my own might be helpful xD.

If for some reason you found this blog and read what I wrote, well, that's a surprise, hahaha, but really nice as
well, so thank you.

And if you have any comments on this blog or some post I did, please feel free to reach me out through the [Github Issue][blog-gh-issue]!
I would appreciate receiving some feedback on anything I wrote or did!

Finally, to build this blog, I'm using [GitHub Pages][github-pages] (that
uses [Jekyll][jekyll]) and the [Minimal Mistakes' theme][minimal-theme].
